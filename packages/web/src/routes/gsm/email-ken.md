Hello Ken,

This will be a lengthy email, because it may be important.

I'll start with the Grand Solar Minimum. The Sun will be going into Solar Cycle 25.
NASA has inconspicuously confirmed the research of Dr. Valentina Zharkova,
	suggesting that Solar Cycle 25 will have the lowest peak in 200 years.
In 1816, Mt. Tambora erupted & the North East United States & Europe experienced "the year without a summer".

Dr. Zharkova has modeled Solar Cycle 26 to be even lower.

re: the Electric Universe Model. It's a unified & fractal model that applies to the cosmos down to the subatomic scale, where everything is rooted as electricity, plasma, & magnetism. Galaxies, Suns, & Planets are connected by Birkeland Currents.

Plasma has been reproduced by physical experiments to create previously unexplained geological features & replicate paleolithic art (or paleolithic art imitates the plasma phenomena).

There's plenty of speculation, however, I find the Electric Universe model explains physical phenomena in a far more elegant way than conventional physics.

Since everything is Electric,  Electrical Engineering applies as the basis of physics. For example, the Sun acts like a Transistor.
